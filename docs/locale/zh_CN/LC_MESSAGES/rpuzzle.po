"In R-puzzle, an ephemeral key ``k`` is never revealed. Instead ``r``, the x "
"coordinate of its corresponding public key, is revealed and from ``r`` along"
" with the signature, the knowledge of ``k`` can be proved using existing "
"``checkSig``."
msgstr ""
"在R-puzzle中，临时私钥 ``k`` 不会被公开，而对应的公钥的横坐标 ``r`` 会被公开。通过 ``r`` 和签名，就可以用 "
"``checkSig`` 检验是否知道 ``k`` 。"

"One crucial step in R-Puzzle is to extract ``r`` from `DER`_ encoded "
"signature. The following is much easier than what is presented in the "
"`R-Puzzle`_ talk."
msgstr ""
"R-Puzzle的一个关键步骤就是从 `DER`_ 编码的签名中提取 ``r`` 。用如下代码，比在 `R-Puzzle`_ "
"的讨论中展示的方法容易多了。"
