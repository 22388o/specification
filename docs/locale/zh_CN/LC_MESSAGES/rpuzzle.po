"In R-puzzle, an ephemeral key ``k`` is never revealed. Instead ``r``, the x "
"coordinate of its corresponding public key, is revealed and from ``r`` along"
" with the signature, the knowledge of ``k`` can be proved using existing "
"``checkSig``. More information can be found in the `R-Puzzle`_ talk."

"在 R-puzzle 中，永远不会公开临时私钥 ``k``。而是公开 ``r``  和来自 ``r`` 的签名，``r`` 是 ``k`` 对应的公钥的"
" x 坐标，并使用现有的 ``checkSig`` 来证明知道 ``k``。更多信息可以在 `R-Puzzle`_  章节中找到。"
