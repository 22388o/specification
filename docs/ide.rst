IDEs

There are currently two IDEs available.

Desktop IDE
-----------
A desktop version is available as a `Visual Studio Code Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bsv-scrypt.sCrypt>`_.
It can easily be found by searching ``sCrypt`` in the Extensions Marketplace. This IDE comes with advanced language features and is intended for professional development.
A `boilerplate project <https://github.com/scrypt-sv/boilerplate>`_ is a good base to kickstart your own sCrypt project.

Web IDE
-------
A browser-based IDE can be found at `scrypt.studio <http://scrypt.studio>`_.
It is for quick learning of sCrypt immediately without any installation and suitable only for small contracts.
Currently, it does not support importing contracts.
